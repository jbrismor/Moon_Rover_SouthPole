# Moon_Rover_SouthPole

This project is a first step toward fully automating Moon rover exploration at the South Pole. The goal is to develop a system capable of safely navigating the lunar surface while reaching designated destinations. The system is built using terrain data from the Moon's South Pole, specifically the LDEM_80S_20MPP_ADJ.TIF file from LOLA found here: https://pgda.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/90.

We plan to expand this project to include resource exploration in target areas and battery management.
